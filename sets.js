/* 
THE ELEMENTS OF A SET ARE CALLED MEMBERS

• A set containing no members is called the empty set. The universe is the set of all
    possible members.
• Two sets are considered equal if they contain exactly the same members.
• A set is considered a subset of another set if all the members of the first set are
    contained in the second set.

THE FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS PERFOMED ON SETS ARE:
• union
• intersection
• difference
